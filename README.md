## Tensorflow Linear Regression fitting a line through data.

  * Tensorflow version `1.8` and Python version `3.5`
  * Here data is generated using numpy with some `random noise`.
  * Used `Gradient Descent Optimizer` to optimize data
  * Set the learning rate to `0.001`
  * Plotted a line passing through this data using Matplotlib.
